                <p>Reconnaissance</p>
                <p>Reconnaissance, also known as the preparatory phase, is where the hacker gathers information about a
                    target before launching an attack and is completed in phases prior to exploiting system
                    vulnerabilities. One of the first phases of Reconnaissance is dumpster diving. It is during this
                    phase that the hacker finds valuable information such as old passwords, names of important employees
                    (such as the head of the network department), and performs an active reconnaissance to know how the
                    organization functions. As a next step, the hacker completes a process called footprinting to
                    collect data on the security posture, reduces the focus area such as finding out specific IP
                    addresses, identifies vulnerabilities within the target system, and finally draws a network map to
                    know exactly how the network infrastructure works to break into it easily. Footprinting provides
                    important information such as the domain name, TCP and UDP services, system names, and passwords.
                    There are also other ways to do footprinting, including impersonating a website by mirroring it,
                    using search engines to find information about the organization, and even using the information of
                    current employees for impersonation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Information Gathering and getting to know the target systems is the first process in ethical hacking.
                    Reconnaissance is a set of processes and techniques (Footprinting, Scanning & Enumeration) used to
                    covertly discover and collect information about a target system.</p>
                <br>
                <p>During reconnaissance, an ethical hacker attempts to gather as much information about a target system
                    as possible, following the seven steps listed below </p>
                <p class="p1">Active vs. Passive Reconnaissance</p>
                <p>MITRE ATT&CK, a popular knowledge base for beginners and security professionals, defines
                    reconnaissance as a fundamental tactic that leverages the “techniques that involve adversaries
                    actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting.”<br>

                    That valuable information is then used to aid further actions, which might involve attacking a
                    vulnerability or additional reconnaissance work. <br><br>

                    Reconnaissance is a critical phase in the adversary cycle. It’s not uncommon for hackers to spend
                    much more time on the pre-attack than on the actual attack. And wrong or incomplete reconnaissance
                    can result in a massive failure for the attackers.
                    <br><br>
                    There are two approaches for reconnaissance: Active and passive. Pentesters often combine these two
                    approaches to assess vulnerabilities and prevent harmful exploitation.
                    <br><br>
                    Ping probes, port scanning, or traceroute are practical examples of active reconnaissance. The
                    attackers directly interact with the targeted machines to enumerate exploitable data.
                    <br><br>
                    Passive reconnaissance is the opposite. The attackers do not engage and instead collect data
                    indirectly, using techniques such as physical observation around buildings, eavesdropping on
                    conversations, finding papers with logins/passwords, Google dorks, open source intelligence (OSINT),
                    advanced Shodan searches, WHOIS data, and packet sniffing.
                </p><br>
                <p class="p1">What Data Do Hackers Collect?</p>
                <br>
                <p>MITRE has identified a number of reconnaissance techniques used by attackers to collect actionable
                    information, such as: </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Active IP addresses, hostnames, open ports, certificates, server banners, gateways, and routers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Credentials, emails, employee names, roles, departments/divisions, and physical location
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Antivirus and EDR tools, SIEM systems (security information and event management), security
                        vendors, software, hardware, firmware, and operating systems
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Domain names, subdomains, CDN, mail servers, and other hosts
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Public WHOIS data such as DNS name servers, IP blocks, and contact information
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Financial data and intellectual property
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Purchased data from reputable sources or black markets
                    </li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>
                    While many of these data types would likely require a direct interaction such as active scanning,
                    it’s still possible to use the results of a previous active scan in a passive analysis, for example,
                    by using a dedicated search engine such as Shodan.

                    Sometimes, hackers only need Google and motivation to find vulnerabilities to exploit.

                    Corporate websites or apps can reveal details about the business relationships, the supply chain,
                    and other sensitive elements. Adversaries can also leverage social media to stalk victims and
                    collect precious information.

                <p>Scanning</p>
                <p>In this phase, the hacker identifies a quick way to gain access to the network and look for
                    information. There are three methods of scanning: pre-attack, port scanning/sniffing, and
                    information extraction. Each of these phases demonstrates a specific set of vulnerabilities that the
                    hacker can utilize to exploit the system's weaknesses. The pre-attack phase is where the hacker
                    scans the network for specific information based on the information gathered during reconnaissance.
                    The port scanner or sniffing phase is where scanning includes the use of dialers, port scanners,
                    vulnerability scanners, and other data-gathering equipment. The information extraction phase is
                    where the attackers collect information about ports, live machines and OS details to launch an
                    attack. </p>

                <p class="p1">What is Network Scanning?</p>
                <p>Network Scanning is the procedure of identifying active hosts, ports and the services used by the
                    target application. Suppose you are an Ethical Hacker and want to find vulnerabilities in the
                    System, you need a point in the System that you can try to attack. Network Scanning for Ethical
                    Hacking is used to find out these points in the system that a Black Hat Hacker can use to hack the
                    network. And then the respective teams work on improving the security of the network. If you are
                    excited to know more about Ethical hacking, join the Ethical Hacking Course Online today.</p><br>
                <p>Every Organization has a Network. This network could be an internal network which consists of all the
                    systems connected with each other, or it can be a network that’s connected to the internet. In
                    either case, to hack the network, you will have to find a vulnerable point in the network that can
                    be exploited. Network Scanning is used to find out such points in the network.</p><br>
                <p class="p1">How is Network Scanning different from Reconnaissance?<br></p>
                <p>Think of it like this: You are an army officer and you and your team are planning to attack a
                    terrorist lair. You have found out the location of the lair and details about the surroundings and
                    also found ways to send the team to the lair. You can consider all this as the information you’ve
                    gathered using Reconnaissance. Now you have to find a point through which you can enter the lair and
                    attack the enemy. This is Network Scanning.<br></p>
                <p>In simple terms, Reconnaissance is used to gather information and understand your target, and Network
                    Scanning is a method used to find possible vulnerable points in the network through which you can
                    hack the network.<br></p>
                <p>Depending on what kind of information the Scan identifies, Network Scanning can be classified into
                    different types.<br></p>
                <p class="p1">Types of Network Scanning for Ethical Hacking<br></p>
                <p>Network Scanning can be classified into two main categories:<br></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Port Scanning</li>
                    <li>Vulnerability Scanning</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Port Scanning--> <br></p>
                <p>As the name suggests, Port Scanning is a process used to find out active ports on the network. A Port
                    Scanner sends client requests to the range of ports on the target network and then saves the details
                    about the ports that send a response back. This is how active ports are found.<br></p>
                <p>There are different types of Port Scanning. Below is a list of some of the most used ones:<br></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>TCP scanning</li>
                    <li>SYN scanning</li>
                    <li>UDP scanning</li>
                    <li>ACK scanning</li>
                    <li>Window scanning</li>
                    <li>FIN scanning</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Vulnerability Scanning--> <br></p>
                <p>Vulnerability Scanning is a type of Network Scanning for Ethical Hacking used to find out weaknesses
                    in the network. This type of scanning identifies vulnerabilities that occur due to poor programming
                    or misconfiguration of the network.<br></p>
                <p>Now that you know what Network Scanning is, I will introduce you to some tools and tell you how to
                    use them for Network Scanning.<br></p>

            <div id="part103" class="part">
                <p>Gain Access <br></p>
                <p>The hacker gains access to the system, applications, and network, and escalates their user privileges
                    to control the systems connected to it. <br> </p>
                <!-- newwwwwww coppyy addedd scannn -->

                <p>In this section, we are going to look at gaining access to the computer device. The computer device
                    means any electric device like a phone, a laptop, a TV, a network, a router, a website, a server.
                    Each device has an operating system, and they have the program installed on these operating systems.
                    We will look at how to gain access to the computers. In this example, we are going to use a
                    computer. We are going to have a Linux device hacker, and we are going to have a window device
                    target. We can apply the same concepts if we are targeting a web server, a laptop or a phone, but we
                    will be considering them all just like a normal computer. We can set up a web server on our
                    computer, we can make it look and act like a website, or even make it act like a TV, or for that
                    matter, anything we want. TVs and all such things are just simple computers with less complicated
                    hardware in them. <br> </p>

                <p class="p1"> Server side <br></p>

                <p>Server-side attack does not require any user interaction. These attacks can be used with the web
                    servers. We can also use them against a normal computer that people use every day. We are going to
                    have a computer, and we will see how we can gain access to that computer without the need for the
                    user to do anything. This attack mostly applies to devices, applications, and web servers that do
                    not get used much by people. Basically, people configure them, and then they run automatically. All
                    we have is an IP. Now, we will see how we can test the security and gain access to that computer
                    based on that IP. Various type of server-side attacks includes buffer overflow, SQL injection, and
                    denial-of-service attacks. <br> </p>

                <br>

                <p class="p1"> client side <br></p>

                <p>The second approach we will try is the client-side attack. This approach requires the client who uses
                    that computer to do something. It involves a number of things like opening a picture, opening a
                    Trojan, or installing an update. We are going to learn how to create backdoors, how to create
                    Trojan, how to use social engineering to make the target person do something so that we will gain
                    access to their computer. In this case, information gathering is going to be crucial, because we
                    actually need to know the person that we are targeting. The various type of client-side attacks
                    includes session fixation, content spoofing, and cross-site scripting. <br> </p>

                <p class="p1"> Post-exploitation <br> </p>

                <p>
                    Once we get access to the target computer, we will see what we can do after we gain access to this
                    computer. This could involve a client-side exploit, server-side exploit, or even just physical
                    access, where the victim leaves their desk, and we get in. In this section, we are going to look at
                    what we can do once we have access to the target. We will also see how we can further exploit that
                    target and increase our privileges, or target other computers in the same place. <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <hr>

                <p>Gaining access attack is the second part of the network penetration testing. In this section, we will
                    connect to the network. This will allow us to launch more powerful attacks and get more accurate
                    information. If a network doesn't use encryption, we can just connect to it and sniff out
                    unencrypted data. If a network is wired, we can use a cable and connect to it, perhaps through
                    changing our MAC address. The only problem is when the target use encryption like WEP, WPA, WPA2. If
                    we do encounter encrypted data, we need to know the key to decrypt it, that's the main purpose of
                    this chapter.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If the network uses encryption, we can't get anywhere unless we decrypt it. In this section, we will
                    discuss that how to break that encryption and how to gain access to the networks whether they use
                    WEP/WPA/WPA2.
                    <br>

                <br>
                <h3 id="serviceh">Social Engineering : </h3>
                <br>
                <p>Social Engineering is the term used by hackers to refer to tricking a human into giving them access,
                    usually by handing over log-in credentials. Although this sounds like an old-fashioned scam, it can
                    be quite sophisticated. More importantly, it can also be quite effective.

                    Cybersecurity analysts estimate that over 80% of attacks are launched using stolen credentials. Once
                    an attacker has the user ID and password of a victim, it’s a simple matter to log in and do what
                    they wish inside the system. Of course, no one would willingly hand over their passwords to a
                    hacker, but it happens frequently.

                    The simplest form of social engineering is to simply impersonate someone in authority and ask for
                    credentials. To do this, hackers will call into an organization and ask to be transferred to someone
                    else (which can help hide the fact that a call is from an outside line). Then, the hacker
                    impersonates an IT staffer trying to troubleshoot a problem. To fool an employee, the hacker needs
                    to take a few steps:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    First, the hacker needs to have some information about the organization and/or the employee to use
                    as context. This creates credibility. For example, they may say, “Joe Jones asked me to look into
                    this personally," knowing that Joe Jones is the COO of the company.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Next, the scammer needs to create a crisis. For example, they may say “I am in so much trouble, I’m
                    afraid my boss will be angry if I don’t get this fixed immediately…” On the other hand, if they
                    don’t think the person will be empathetic, they may say “Someone was surfing some shopping sites on
                    this computer, which is against company policy. We have an audit coming up next week, and I don’t
                    want you to get into trouble. Allow me to delete the history for you." After that, the scammer will
                    ask the employee to do some small task, such as open a command window and type “netstat." This fills
                    the screen with technical jargon which is used to frighten an employee.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, when the hook is set, the scammer asks for the employee’s ID and password to continue
                    fixing the problem (usually right before lunch or at the end of the day when the employee wants to
                    leave). This is only one approach, but there are many other ways to fool employees by impersonating
                    a vendor, customer, or executive.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                <br>
                <h3 id="serviceh">Website Hacking :</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Perhaps the oldest and most well-known cybersecurity attack is to hack into a website, and there are
                    many ways to do it. It’s a very broad topic, but some of the more common types of attacks will be
                    outlined here.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    First, one of the most obvious ways to hack into a website is to look at the URL and observe the
                    changes as the user traverses pages the website. In simple websites, you’ll notice that links on the
                    website are really just tracing a directory structure. Many websites can be hacked simply by putting
                    other information into the URL bar in the browser and experimenting.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A famous travel website was hacked when attackers noticed the user number in the URL at the top of
                    the browser. By simply putting other numbers in, they could see the accounts of other users. Of
                    course, trial and error can be tedious, so many hackers use tools like URL fiddlers to experiment
                    for them automatically. Hackers also use tools like Burpsuite to customize their responses to
                    webforms and insert intentional errors to cause the website controls to fail.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Many websites use a database (such as a SQL database) backend to store information. Poorly written
                    websites often include the database commands in the URL links where they are visible, or directly
                    from fields in forms. Using a technique called SQL injection, a hacker can add additional database
                    commands which get passed directly through the webserver to the database.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3 id="serviceh">
                    Sophisticated Penetration</h3>
                <br>
                <p> Another way to hack into an organization is to use sophisticated attack tools to penetrate networks
                    and directly attack servers and computers. This is probably most similar to the hacker approaches
                    shown on TV and movies, where the attacker, types a few keys and announces, “I’m in!”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In reality, it's not so simple, but there are techniques for doing this. If an attacker is
                    physically close, they may be able to use a tool like Aircrack-NG to hack into a WiFi access
                    wireless network to gain access to the network. Even better, if an attacker can get inside the
                    building briefly to install a device (called a turtle) to call back out to them later, access is
                    easy. If no local access is possible, attackers still have other methods to penetrate an
                    organization.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By scanning an organization, attackers may locate machines with known vulnerabilities that can be
                    exploited. Often, this is simply an old, forgotten computer that has not been updated and patched.
                    If an attacker can scan it, they can use attacks like buffer overflows or exploit weaknesses in
                    protocols like SMB and RDP to get access to the machine. Once they get into the machine, the
                    attacker can install additional software to launch attacks against other machines in the
                    network.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3 id="serviceh">
                    Hackers Will Exploit Security Flaws </h3>
                <br>
                <p>While the technical details have been omitted here (for obvious security reasons) the message is
                    clear. It’s just not that difficult for attackers to gain access to a network or computer,
                    especially if it’s not been protected adequately. Typical protections include malware and virus
                    detection, firewalls and intrusion detection, as well as strict policies on software patching and
                    updates.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Security engineers can take many other steps to reduce the risk of attack and intrusion. However, it
                    takes good training to do that.<br>

                <p>Maintain Access <br></p>
                <p>Here, the hacker secures access to the organization’s Rootkits and Trojans and uses it to launch
                    additional attacks on the network. <br></p>

                <p class="p1"> The Concept of Maintaining Access <br></p>
                <p>When a system is compromised, the attacker is given temporary access to it (not including compromised
                    management services such as SSH, telnet, etc.). If the system were to power cycle or the gained
                    access be interrupted by some means, access would be lost. But, if quick action is taken by the
                    attacker upon initial compromise, access can be maintained or persistent.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This persistent access often takes the form of a backdoor, which starts along with the system to
                    give the attacker access without need for further exploitation. Launching a high number of exploits
                    in an attempt to gain access to the same system is likely to alert an admin (a good one at least),
                    and might lock you out for good. So, persistent access is definitely the way to go. <br>
                </p>
                <p class="p1"> Penetration testing: maintaining access <br></p>
                <p>Once a pentester manages to gain access to the target system, he should work hard to keep his boat
                    afloat, metaphorically speaking. He can choose either to use the hijacked system as a launching-pad
                    (i.e., to be part of a botnet for DDoS attacks or spam campaigns), at this moment attack, scan and
                    exploit other systems, or keep on exploiting the current system in stealth mode. Both actions can
                    entail a great deal of damage. <br></p>
                <br>

                <p class="p1"> Maintaining Access with Metasploit <br> </p>
                <p> Now that we’ve discussed what exactly is means to obtain persistent access, we can go ahead and try
                    it for ourselves. Thankfully, Metasploit comes equipped to get the job done. First we’ll gain access
                    to the victim PC, then we’ll establish our persistent access. Once that’s all done, we’ll restart
                    the victim PC and reconnect to the backdoor!<br></p><br>

                <p class="p1">Methods to Maintain access<br></p>
                <p>In the previous section, we had seen that when the target user restarted the computer, we would lose
                    our connection. We used a normal backdoor that's why, when the computer restarted, our backdoor
                    would be terminated, the process would be terminated, and we would lose our connection. But in this
                    section, we are going to discuss the methods that will allow us to maintain our access to the target
                    computer. We are going to use a normal HTTP reverse Mterepreter undetectable backdoor that we
                    created previously. We are going to inject it as a service so that it will run every time the target
                    user run their computer and it will try to connect back to us at certain intervals. To do this, we
                    will run background command and interact with the session on number 2.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We are going to run a module using the command use exploit/windows/local/persistence. It is like a
                    multi-handler module that comes with Metasploit. After this command, we will run the show options
                    command to see what we need to configure, as shown in the following screenshot: <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="/methods-to-maintain-access.png" alt="">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> The first thing that we are going to look at DELAY, it is the number of seconds during which the
                    target will try to connect back to us. It is set as 10, that means every 10 seconds, the target
                    computer will try to connect back to us. Now, we are going to set EXE_NAME. It is the name that will
                    show up under the processes where the connection is responding back from. We will set EXE_NAME to
                    browse.exe to make it less detectable. The command is as follows: <br></p><br><br>
                <img src="/methods-to-maintain-access2.png" alt=""><br>
                <br>
                <p> The PATH where the backdoor or payload will be installed, and it will stay the same. The REG_NAME is
                    the register entry, and it will also stay the same. The SESSION specifies the session, if we run the
                    session -l command, it will list of the available sessions, as shown in the following screenshot:
                    <br>
                </p><br><br>
                <img src="/methods-to-maintain-access3.png" alt=""><br><br>
                <p> Now we are going to set the SESSION as 2 using the following command: <br></p><br><br>
                <img src="/methods-to-maintain-access4.png" alt=""><br><br>
                <p> The STARTUP will be left as USER, for the user privileges. Now, we are going to run show options. In
                    the following screenshot, we can see that browser.exe and session number 2 are set properly: <br>
                </p><br><br>

                <img src="/methods-to-maintain-access5.png" alt=""><br><br>
                <p> Now, we are going to specify the payload that will be injected as a service. To do this we will run
                    the show advanced command, and it will show us the advanced options that we can set up for this
                    particular module. In the following screenshot, we are interested in EXE::Custom, which indicates
                    that we are going to use a custom .exe to run and inject into the target computer as a service: <br>
                </p><br><br>
                <img src="/methods-to-maintain-access6.png" alt=""><br><br>
                <p> We are going to set EXE::Custom to /var/www/html/backdoor.exe, so that we can run our backdoor that
                    stored in /var/www/html/backdoor.exe. The command is as follows : <br></p><br><br>
                <img src="/methods-to-maintain-access7.png" alt=""><br><br>
                <p> Now, we will run show advanced command, and see that it was set up properly, as shown in the
                    following screenshot: <br></p><br><br>
                <img src="/methods-to-maintain-access8.png" alt=""><br><br>
                <p> Now, we are going to run exploit command. It will upload /var/www/html/backdoor.exe onto the target
                    computer, using the session that we specified, which is 2. In the following screenshot, we can see
                    that it has been uploaded and installed: <br></p><br><br>
                <img src="/methods-to-maintain-access9.png" alt=""><br><br>
                <p> If we don't want the backdoor on the target computer anymore, we can use the resource file to delete
                    it. We can store the RC file as shown in the preceding screenshot into the Leafpad so that we can
                    run it in the future and delete our backdoor.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If we run session -l command, it will show the available sessions, and we can interact with it.
                    Using the session -k command, we can kill that session.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now, if we run list command, we will see that we have no connection with the target computer. Using
                    our exploit multi-handler, we can listen for an incoming connection.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If we run exploit, and the hacked computer is already booted, we will get a connection straightway,
                    because our target has been injected into the target computer on port 8080 on reverse_http. Now to
                    make sure, we will start our Window machine. To make sure that we will always have a connection to
                    it, we are going to restart the target Windows computer. At every 10 seconds, our Kali machine will
                    try to connect back to it, no matter how many times the Windows machine is shut down or restarted.
                    We will now run our Meterpreter handler and wait for a connection. And then run the exploit command
                    to listen, it will take a maximum of 10 seconds to get a connection back. In the following
                    screenshot, we can see that we received a connection to the target computer, and now we have full
                    access to that computer:<br>

                <p class="p1">The 5 Phases of Hacking: Maintaining Access<br></p><br><br>
                <br>
                <h3 id="serviceh">Stealth : <br></h3>

                <p> The first way a hacker maintains persistence is to not be detected. After all, if the user or IT
                    staff detects the intrusion, they will deal with it quickly. Therefore, for example, if a user opens
                    an email attachment (with malware), the malware is typically designed to run in the background or in
                    a small window behind the main window. Likewise, malware is often encoded to avoid detection by
                    scanners looking for specific known signatures.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It’s also critical for attackers to be stealthy in their actions. When scanning a network for other
                    targets, they often slow down scans to a trickle of packets. While this can take longer (hours in
                    some cases), they can avoid attracting suspicion from network intrusion tools and IT staff.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When a target is discovered with information the hacker wants to steal, they often use very slow
                    methods to extract the data from the server or computer. They don’t want their actions to burden the
                    machine and possibly cause it to slow down, and they want the data to be mixed in with all of the
                    legitimate data on the network to avoid detection.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They also make sure the connection from the target to their collection machines waiting outside is
                    established from the inside out, so it looks like legitimate traffic. In cases of extreme stealth,
                    hackers will sometimes hide their data in innocuous-looking Domain Name Server (DNS) requests or web
                    service requests rather than using an obvious file transfer protocol (FTP).<br>

                <br>
                <h3 id="serviceh">Privilege Escalation : <br></h3>
                <p> Once hackers have infiltrated a server or PC, it is common to immediately try to get higher-level
                    permissions on that machine. This is called privilege escalation and serves two purposes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    First, the hacker can establish a new account as the server administrator with a unique ID and
                    password. This allows the hacker to simply log in for access on the next visit, rather than trying
                    to inject malware each time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It also allows the hacker to install and run even more software on the machine. This is useful for
                    scanning other machines in the environment and subsequently hacking into them as well.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Privilege escalation is also used at the network level. For example, if hackers can get into a
                    Windows Active Directory server and escalate privileges to the administrator, they can access any
                    machine in the network. Likewise, if a hacker gets administrative privileges in routers or switches,
                    they can make changes to the infrastructure to access remote segments in other parts of the
                    organization. <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 id="serviceh"> Backdoors : <br></h3>
                <p>The hacker may install software called a “backdoor,” which allows the hacker to remotely log into a
                    server or computer without detection. Some backdoors have also been discovered in routers and
                    switches as well.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even with all of this, it’s often difficult for backdoor software to survive multiple software
                    patches and revisions, especially if the operating system is upgraded. Therefore, hackers install
                    “rootkits." These are malware packages installed in the kernel level of the machine and boot up
                    before the operating system.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Therefore, even if the operating system is completely reinstalled, the hacker maintains access. Some
                    rootkits developed by nation-states are installed in the boot sector of the hard drive, so they can
                    even survive entire disk reformatting.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to avoid detection by virus scanners on computers, some modern malware packages are built
                    to run in memory only without ever writing a file to disk (which could be detected). These malware
                    executables are often launched by rootkits. They run outside the operating system, so they are very
                    difficult to detect by anti-virus software running inside the operating system.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 id="serviceh"> Covering Tracks : <br></h3>
                <p> Another area that sophisticated hackers concentrate on is to hide any evidence that they have
                    infiltrated a computer or system. In fact, if they can successfully hide their presence and delete
                    malware as they depart, an attack might never be detected.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Hackers do this by trying to locate every log and file that would maintain some record of their
                    presence or movement. For example, Windows and Linux machines keep logs of all logins and actions
                    taken on the computer. These are intended for troubleshooting but can be used for forensic purposes
                    to detect illegal entry. Hackers know this, so they need to deal with these logs.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The easiest course of action for a hacker is to simply delete the log, but this would cause
                    suspicion. Some hackers simply edit the logs to remove only the entries showing their presence.
                    However, an astute researcher would notice a gap in the log time stamps.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Therefore, advanced hackers will replace a section of the log with a previous section with updated
                    timestamps. Even this can be detected, but with much greater difficulty. Even with these
                    precautions, an attacker needs to take additional steps to remove evidence of the attack.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Windows machines not only have logs, but also an index file database of all software that was ever
                    installed (even after it is deleted). That would need to be cleared as well. Further, some graphics
                    processors have the memory of screen actions that would also need to be deleted.<br>
                </p>

                <br>
                <h3 id="serviceh"> Determined Hackers Will Gain and Maintain Access : <br></h3>
                <p> The most sophisticated are excellent at hiding their presence in an attack. This not only allows
                    them more time on target (loitering time), but also helps to hide the intrusion long after they have
                    left the target. This allows them to make repeated visits if necessary. More importantly, the attack
                    signatures are not picked up by threat researchers and published to other victims.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In every case, security engineers can take steps to reduce the risk of attack and intrusion.
                    However, it takes good training to do that.<br>

                <br>

                <p class="p1"> Conclusion <br></p><br>
                <p> “Maintaining Access” is a phase of the pentest cycle which has a very concrete purpose – to allow
                    the pentester to linger in the targeted systems until he acquires what information he considers to
                    be valuable and then manages to extract it successfully from the system. However, as is often the
                    case, it is easier said than done. Let’s compare it to being in someone else’s house without his
                    permission – it is one thing to enter his home and walk around for a while, but it is another matter
                    when you want to settle in for a little longer without attracting the owner’s attention. While such
                    a Houdini-like trick may be a tad easier in the cyber world, it remains challenging. Challenging but
                    not impossible.<br></p><br><br>

                <p>Cover Tracks</p>
                <p>Once the hacker gains access, they cover their tracks to escape the security personnel. They do this
                    by clearing the cache and cookies, tampering the log files, and closing all the open ports. This
                    step is important because it clears the system information making hacking a great deal harder to
                    track.</p><br>
                <p>Covering tracks is one of the most stage during system hacking. during this stage, the attacker tries
                    to cover and avoid being detected, or “traced out,” by covering all track, or logs, generated while
                    gaining access to the target networks or computer.<br></p><br>
                <p> Covering Tracks we’ve got how an attacker hides malicious files on a target computer using various
                    stenographic techniques, NTFS streams, among others, to keep up future access to the target. Now
                    that the attacker has succeeded in performing this malicious operation, following step are to get
                    rid of any resultant traces/tracks within the system, Covering tracks is one in all the most stage
                    during system hacking. during this stage, the attacker tries to cover and avoid being detected, or
                    “traced out,” by covering all “tracks,” or logs, generated while gaining access to the target
                    network or computer. let’s see how the attacker removes traces of an attack within the target
                    computer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Erasing evidence may be a requirement for an attacker who would love to stay obscure. this can be
                    one method to evade a traceback. This starts with erasing the contaminated logs and possible error
                    messages generated within the attack process. Then, attackers make changes within the system
                    configuration in order that it does riot log future activities, By manipulating and tweaking the
                    event logs, attackers trick the supervisor in believing that there’s no malicious activity within
                    the system, which no intrusion or compromise has actually taken place.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Because the primary thing a supervisor does in monitoring unusual activity is to see the system log
                    files, it’s common for intruders to use a utility to change these logs. in some cases, rootkits can
                    disable and discard all existing rugs. Attackers remove only those portions of logs that may reveal
                    their presence if they shall use the system for an extended period as a launch base for the longer
                    term exploitation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is imperative for attackers to form the system appear because it did before access was gained and
                    a backdoor established. this enables them to vary any file attributes back to their original state.
                    Information listed, like file size and date, simply attributes information contained within the
                    file.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Protecting against attackers trying to hide their tracks by changing file information is often
                    difficult. However, it’s possible to detect whether an attacker has done so by calculating the
                    filters cryptographic hash, this sort of hash could be a calculation of the whole file before
                    encryption.<br>

                <h3 id="serviceh">The attacker can manipulate the log files with the assistance of :</h3><br>
                <p> – SECEVENT.EVT (security): failed logins, accessing files without privileges <br><br>

                <h3 id="serviceh">Techniques used for covering Tracks</h3><br>
                <p> The main activities that an attacker performs toward removing his/her traces on the pc are:
                    <br><br>
                    – Disable auditing: An attacker disables auditing features of the target system <br><br>
                    – Clearing logs: An attacker clears/deletes the system log entries like his/her activities <br><br>
                    – Manipulating logs: An attacker manipulates logs in such some way that he/she won’t be caught in
                    legal actions
                    <br><br>
                    Thus, the whole job of an attacker involves not only compromising the system successfully, but also
                    disabling logging, clearing Log files, eliminating evidence, planting additional tools, and covering
                    his/her tracks. <br>

                <p>One of the first steps for an attacker who has command-line capability is to see the auditing status
                    of the target system, locate sensitive files (such as password files), and implant automatic
                    information-gathering tools (such as a keystroke logger or network sniffer).

                    <br>
                    Windows records certain events to the Event Log (or associated Syslog). The log is often set to send
                    alerts (email, pager, then on) to the computer user. Therefore, the attacker will want to know the
                    auditing status of the system he/she is trying to compromise before proceeding with his/her plans.
                    <br>

                    Auditpol.exe is the instruction utility tool to alter Audit Security settings at the category and
                    sub-category levels. Attackers can use Auditpol to enable or disable security auditing on local or
                    remote systems and to regulate the audit criteria for various categories of security events. <br>

                <p class="p1">Penetration Testing: Covering Tracks</p><br>
                <p>“Covering Tracks” is the final stage of a penetration test as a process – all the rest is paperwork.
                    In a nutshell, its goal is to erase the digital signs left out by the pen tester during the earlier
                    stages of the test. These digital signs, in essence, prove the pen tester’s presence in the targeted
                    computer system.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whereas in the phases previous to this one the pen tester successfully managed to avoid detection by
                    firewalls and intrusion detection systems, the purpose of this phase is to cover up all the little
                    clues that would give away the nature of his deeds. “Covering Tracks” consists of 1) measures for
                    the prevention of real-time detection (Anti-Incident Response), and 2) measures for the prevention
                    of digital evidence collection during a possible post factum inquiry (Anti-Forensics).<br>

                <p>Its purpose is to confuse, out-maneuver and disrupt the incident response team at the targeted
                    company. Moreover, anti-incident response activities ensure a pen tester would have the opportunity
                    to gain a long-term foothold on the attacked network even if he has already been detected.

                    Some important components of a workable anti-incident response are:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Secretly deploy backdoors

                <h3 id="serviceh">Anti-Forensics</h3><br>
       
                <p>Computer forensics is a discipline whose purpose is to allow forensic experts to acquire, preserve,
                    analyze and present digital evidence in the court of law. Anti-forensics is a notion encompassing
                    all methods and tools which exist to delete, change or conceal digital evidence, with the ultimate
                    goal being the manipulation, destruction or erasure of digital evidence. Marc Rogers, a professor in
                    the Computer Technology Department at Purdue University, formulates anti-forensics as: “Attempts to
                    negatively affect the existence, amount and/or quality of evidence from a crime scene, or make the
                    analysis and examination of evidence difficult or impossible to conduct.”

                    <br>
                    The term itself suggests that it has something to do with actions or techniques whose leitmotiv is
                    to obstruct an eventual digital investigation and to diminish the quality and quantity of digital
                    evidence. Typical users of anti-forensic tools and techniques are hackers, cyber terrorists, online
                    pedophiles, counterfeiters and other cyber criminals who want to remove existing traces of nefarious
                    computer activities which may incriminate them. Nevertheless, pen testers have recourse to the
                    antipode of the digital forensic science as well to do what they do best – conduct a thorough test
                    of the security capabilities of particular computer systems.

                    With the help of automated tools, the pen tester can mask the attack and create backdoors for
                    further exploitation at the same time. The information security portal Security Wizardry has created
                    a list of anti-forensic tools which can be found here.<br>

                <h3 id="serviceh">Deleting Evidence</h3><br>
            
                <p>A common delusion among persons who count on commercial disk cleaners or privacy protection tools to
                    delete some data they do not want others to see is the belief that these tools remove everything
                    from the hard disc once and for all. In fact, they can clean up the following kind of information:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Cache and history for popular Web browsers
                    Chat logs produced by Skype and some other popular instant messengers
                    Provide “secure delete” option to wipe files
                    Clean some (but almost never all) of the following: jumplists, thumbnails, registry items, Skype
                    chatsync, etc.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By utilizing specific forensic tools, a forensic expert can outsmart almost all clean-up programs.
                    In reality, they can be an effective solution for casual observers, but not that effective
                    anti-forensic measure when we take into account the amount of information that pass through, namely:
                    thumbnails cache, Windows jumplists, browsing cache and history, chatsync, undeleted files being
                    currently opened at the moment of deletion, deleted files with left corresponding Registry entries
                    intact, etc.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Pictures of interest, for instance, can be recovered because, even if the original image has been
                    deleted, a smaller version of this picture should still exist in Windows Thumbnails. And even if the
                    thumbnail has been removed, forensic examiners could attempt to restore it via file carving. Windows
                    Vista, Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and Windows 10 usually keep their thumbnails stored in one location (i.e.,
                    %userprofile%AppDataLocalMicrosoftWindowsExplorer). Alternatively, there are automated tools
                    designed to perform that task.<br>

                <h3 id="serviceh">Moving, Hiding, Altering or Renaming Files</h3><br>
            
                <p>Although it may seem naive, some wrongdoers use these techniques in the hope of evading justice. In
                    this case, ‘covering tracks’ can take the form of moving given files (for instance, those that
                    contain conversation histories), changing extensions or renaming.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is an arduous task to retrieve and rearrange the hidden data. Some programs can split files into
                    small partitions and conceal each partition at the end of other files. With the help of the right
                    programs, a pen tester can take advantage of an unused file space dubbed slack space, thereby hiding
                    important information in plain sight.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Similarly, a pen tester can hide one file inside another (more or less like steganography) – a
                    method which copes well with executable files, in particular. In this regard, J. Strickland
                    mentioned in his article “How Computer Forensics Works“: “Programs called packers can insert
                    executable files into other kinds of files, while tools called binders can bind multiple executable
                    files together.”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Timestamping: More often than not, the people involved in a cyber investigation do not have the time
                    to examine one by one all the files residing in a computer system. One approach which allows them to
                    prioritize their search of information potentially relevant to the investigation is to arrange this
                    information in chronological order so that they can focus on the important pieces of data occurred
                    around the moment of the cybercrime (if it is known). Criminals, however, try to tackle this
                    approach by modifying the metadata about any files they want. In most cases, they change the date on
                    which each file was created, last accessed, or last modified. This effective anti-forensic technique
                    is named time stopping, and tools to detect its creations do exist.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Among the anti-forensic inventory, there are tools that can alter the information in file headers.
                    Once the transformation is completed, the computer will think it is a different type of file (for
                    example, to rename an mp3 file so that it will appear as a .gif one).<br>
                </p><br><br>


                <h3 id="serviceh">Log Tampering</h3><br>
     
                <p>In Windows-based computer systems, all of the log files are stored in the event viewer, easily
                    findable via the “Search” bar. In almost all Linux and UNIX operating systems the log files are
                    located in the /var/log directory, and in MAC operating systems one should open the Finder, click
                    “Go to Folder” in the Go menu, and type in /Library/Logs and press Enter to activate the Log File
                    Management which will display all log files.<br></p><br>
                <img src="/ct2.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
                <p>If administrators want to check for malicious activities within the system for which they are
                    responsible, they simply examine the log files. There are two kinds of log files: system generated
                    and application generated.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When it comes to log manipulation, the attacker usually has two options. The first option is to
                    delete the log, and the second one is to alter its content. Deletion of log files and replacement of
                    system binaries with Trojan malware ensures that the security staff employed by the targeted company
                    will not detect evidence of the cyber intrusion.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The first choice – to delete the log files – is not always the ultimate solution to undetectability,
                    since the removal of such information might create a gap between logs files and raise suspicion. One
                    look at the processes and log files would be enough for a system administrator at the target’s
                    premises to establish the existence of any malicious activities. So, chances are the system
                    administrator may notice when a log file is deleted. Log files are used to detect malicious
                    activities, but that is only one of their purposes; they serve as a warning system on the actual
                    state and health of the system, and any irregularities with their availability or attributes may
                    draw unwanted attention. Presumably, it will be prudent on the part of the attacker if he decides to
                    wait for a time when the probability of system administrators to check the log data is minimal, for
                    instance, during nighttime or weekends.<br>

                <h3 id="serviceh">Conclusion </h3><br>
            
                <p>Being stealthy is a great precondition for success. For that reason, avoiding detection until the
                    penetration test is over is sometimes not enough (i.e., the anti-response part). Sometimes it is
                    very important that the cyber attack as a fact will continue to remain unknown to the victim after
                    its end, regardless whether we talk about a pen test or an actual cybercrime. And if you happen to
                    set off the radar detection, anti-forensics should come to the rescue.

                    Some people undeservingly tend to underestimate the significance of “Covering Tracks” phase. Perhaps
                    they think that their job is done when the objective of the mission is completed (e.g., to obtain a
                    bundle of valuable documents). However, if you want to get the knack of penetrating sophisticated
                    systems, it is imperative to learn how to do so in as low-profile manner as possible. And that is
                    exactly where “Covering Tracks” phase comes into play. It is simply a fail-safe mechanism for pen
                    testers and hackers which would keep them out of trouble, both immediate and such that might occur
                    during an investigation.<br></p><br><br>
